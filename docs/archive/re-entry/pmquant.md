## Landed this wrap: pmquant child (PR #7)

- `children/pmquant/` — prediction-market ladders (Kalshi, Polymarket) as
  thin tier-3 kinds + JSON over dskit seams. `configs/run-e2e.json` is the
  proof document (22 nodes; `tests/test_e2e.py` runs it on the synthetic
  world). `run-kalshi-ladders.json` is its real-data twin.
- dskit generic, ADR-0075…0080: onboarding packs `kalshi`, `polymarket`,
  `predexon` + `leads.py`; the `localtables` connector; the `observations`
  pipeline kind; the public clause DSL; `acquired_at` is the commit instant;
  one backoff ceiling (`connector.MAX_BACKOFF_S`); Polymarket `closedTime`.
- **Waiting on the owner:** `PREDEXON_API_KEY` in the environment before
  `configs/source-predexon.json` can pull; the twin's real-data run on a
  machine holding `~/pmquant_data`; the rulings listed in `TODO.md` under
  "Found by the pmquant child build".
- Also merged: `chore/quote-pull-budget` — the Alpaca quotes backfill
  `budget_seconds` 3000 → 570, so an interrupted pull loses under ten minutes.
- `fix/hstar-min-split-gain` is the pre-rewrite lineage (no common ancestor
  with `main`); every file it carries is already in `main`. Safe to delete.
