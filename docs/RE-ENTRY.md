# Re-entry

Current wrap: 2026-09-04 on `p11-asset-local-gates-1-2`, based on synchronized
`main`. P11 is complete through Gates 1 and 2; no pipeline is running and Gate
3 was neither configured nor run.

Last verification: 60 focused tests passed; Ruff and `git diff --check` are
clean. The full suite was not rerun. One unrelated pre-existing config pin
still rejects the 2020 start in `run-pb-s01-h01-lgbm-cross.json` against 2018.

## PICK UP HERE: review P11 asset-local Gates 1 and 2

ADR-0082 is accepted. P11 trains one model per asset, stops the ordered
`h=1,2,3,5,10,20,30,60` search at the first Gate-1 failure, and confirms only
the selected horizon on untouched 2025-12-02 through 2026-02-28 observations.
The generic fixed-family ledger reserves all 25 Bonferroni slots at alpha
0.05 (0.002 each), valid under arbitrary dependence and arrival order.

Gate 1 selected 13 assets: LLY h3, QQQ h1, XLF h3, XLE h1, XLK h5, TQQQ h3,
NVDA h2, UPRO h60, BAC h1, AVGO h10, NFLX h3, SMH h5, and IWM h5. All 13
failed Gate 2; UPRO was closest (raw p=0.0132419, adjusted p=0.331047). The
other 12 assets failed Gate 1 at h1 and never entered confirmation. Full rows
are in the P11 staged artifacts and append-only decision ledgers.

Next step: review this branch and merge it when approved. No design decision is
awaiting the owner; there is no fallback continuation after the Gate-2 result.

## Landed this wrap: pmquant child (PR #7)

- `children/pmquant/` — prediction-market ladders (Kalshi, Polymarket) as
  thin tier-3 kinds + JSON over dskit seams. `configs/run-e2e.json` is the
  proof document (22 nodes; `tests/test_e2e.py` runs it on the synthetic
  world). `run-kalshi-ladders.json` is its real-data twin.
- dskit generic, ADR-0075…0080: onboarding packs `kalshi`, `polymarket`,
  `predexon` + `leads.py`; the `localtables` connector; the `observations`
  pipeline kind; the public clause DSL; `acquired_at` is the commit instant;
  one backoff ceiling (`connector.MAX_BACKOFF_S`); Polymarket `closedTime`.
- **Waiting on the owner:** `PREDEXON_API_KEY` in the environment before
  `configs/source-predexon.json` can pull; the twin's real-data run on a
  machine holding `~/pmquant_data`; the rulings listed in `TODO.md` under
  "Found by the pmquant child build".
- Also merged: `chore/quote-pull-budget` — the Alpaca quotes backfill
  `budget_seconds` 3000 → 570, so an interrupted pull loses under ten minutes.
- `fix/hstar-min-split-gain` is the pre-rewrite lineage (no common ancestor
  with `main`); every file it carries is already in `main`. Safe to delete.

## Reference

P10 result:
`pipeline_runs/p10-25-asset-modelability-staged-2026-02-28-b7c8efe9`

P10 memo:
`children/intraday_equities/docs/memos/p10-modelability-pipeline.md`

P10 used pooled 25-asset fits and a study-wide 200-cell max-statistic
correction. Gate 2 retained QQQ at three minutes and NFLX at ten; both later
failed Gate 3's frozen null-spread calibration. P11 changes the estimand and
must not overwrite or reinterpret those artifacts.
